In this project we look at some real data from CHILDES database, Eve fragment. We will
study the effect of training on grammar of Eve. 

Thsis grammar is hypothesized by us, Seda Demirel and Cem Bozsahin. It is based on 5k plus
Eve-directed speech from CHILDES. The files in this folder are:

- eve.gram.initial : contains Eve grammar before the start of experiments. All parameter values are same. Note explicit mention of that in the file.

- eve.gram.current : contains a grammar model which is considered good after training. Note that parameters values are not default.

- eve.give.sup : contains Eve-directed speech involving the verb 'give'.

- eve.exp : contains values for further experimentation (by you).

- eve.give.sup.check.tbc : contains TheBench commands for doing PART I below.
