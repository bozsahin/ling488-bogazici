/‾\ /‾\  pass train en.gram on first SVO supervision, second, OVS supervision


/‾\ /‾\  t en.gram en.sup.svo en.svo.exp

no errors in grammar text, proceeding with set up..
please check the /var/tmp/thebench/en.gram.log file for information.
no errors in supervision data, proceeding with set up..
please check the /var/tmp/thebench/en.sup.svo.log file for information.

Training starts.
Please hit RETURN if the prompt is not back on.
You don't have to wait for the finish.
  You can continue to do other things in the interface
    or leave the session. Training runs in the background.

You can use 'top' command of linux to follow the progress
  Look for COMMAND column for processes named 'sbcl'.
  These are the currently running training processes.

Summary of experiments for locating results when done
------ Experiment 1 ------
result goes to: /var/tmp/thebench/svo-nfparse.8.0.5a.1.2c.src
     log file : /var/tmp/thebench/svo-nfparse.log (contains summary of parameter change)
initial call  : nfparse-on (before the experiment starts)
------ Experiment 2 ------
result goes to: /var/tmp/thebench/svo-nonfparse.15.1.2a.1.0c.src
     log file : /var/tmp/thebench/svo-nonfparse.log (contains summary of parameter change)
initial call  : nfparse-off (before the experiment starts)
------ Experiment 3 ------
result goes to: /var/tmp/thebench/svo-bon.10.0.5a.1.1c.src
     log file : /var/tmp/thebench/svo-bon.log (contains summary of parameter change)
initial call  : beam-on (before the experiment starts)
--------------------------
If everything runs OK, you can re-generate source grammars from .src files
   use the z command for that

!!! Please do NOT hit ctrl-D in THIS terminal app. It would terminate the experiments.


/‾\ /‾\  pass the following t command reloads en.gram so parameters are reset 


/‾\ /‾\  pass   before training.
