Ling 48: Exploring Natural Languages by Modeling (Bogazici Linguistics elective course)

This is the web page of the course when I teach it.


Modeling here refers to exploring models which are consequences of a theory.
This is not a course on large-language models or small language models,
which do not attempt that.
