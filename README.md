Ling 488: Exploring Natural Languages by Modeling (Bogazici Linguistics elective course)

This is the web page of the course when I teach it.


Modeling here refers to exploring models which are consequences of a theory.
This is not a course on large-language models or small language models,
which do not attempt that.

Scientific models are transparent; they don't have
response parameters or fine-tuning of results, to promote independent replication of the experiments and assessment of results. A scientific model is preparing a theory or an idea for experiments. 

This course covers one way to build scientific models of natural grammars.
